Hello, my name is Robert and I'm a DevOps engineer who enjoys working on new technologies and find solutions to complex problems. My first endevour with UNIX was at a small Dial-up ISP, a 2.2.8 FreeBSD system that intimidated me when I first saw it. Ended up loving it and still enjoy tinkering with UNIX and network systems in my spare time.
